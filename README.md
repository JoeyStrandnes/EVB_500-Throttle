# EVB 500 Throttle Control
###### This is a short summery of the inner workings of the throttle control and how to easily emulate and fix it.

###### This is not a guide on increasing the power or speed of the electric scooter. 



###### The throttle control of my friends EVB 500 electric scooter broke and I offered to fixe it. The throttle sensors leads had broken of and needed replacement. 



### Throttle construction

###### The throttle consists of two parts, one moving (handle) and one static.  The handle has embedded magnets that rotate with the handle and the  static part has a linear hall effect sensor that measures the magnetic field and outputs a analog voltage proportional to the measured magnetic field. 

###### The EVB 500 uses the D49E-757H, 49E-Series linear hall effect sensor by YANGZHOU POSITIONING TECH. The sensor is directly connected between VCC (~5V) red cable, GND (black cable) and outputs a analog voltage between 0.9V-4.2V on the green cable.  A control pin voltage equal to 4.2V will result in MAX throttle and <0.9V results in no power going to the motor. The voltage in-between the thresholds is linearly proportional to the speed. Example;  2.55V would result in 50% motor speed.

###### The main control unit of the electric scooter has some sort of sanity check and refuses an instant 4.2V on the throttle pin (green cable) so a switch between VCC and throttle pin will not work (not even with a voltage divider or regulated 4.2V). 

###### The control unit requires a ramp-up in voltage from 0V to desired voltage/speed in order to pass the sanity check, the speed of the ramp-up can very a lot without any consequences and does not seem to be particularly picky. 



### Fixing the throttle

#### Electronics

###### The obvious solution would be to replace the sensor with an identical one, I was unable to find one and did not want to wait for one to show up. Finding a similar one would also be an alternative but we decided to just get it working with standard components we already had at our disposal. A potentiometer can be used, it worked but was not comfortable to use as a throttle. The "cruse control" button would be used as the  throttle, press the button for full throttle and release it for zero throttle, it was already a part of the scooter and was comfortably mounted to the handle. 

###### An Arduino micro (ATMega32u4) was used to convert the binary ON/OFF signal from the button to a value that the main controller could read. Virtually any microcontroller could be used as long as it has a PWM output. The button is connected to a regular digital pin and the green wire (motor controller/ throttle cable) is connected to a microcontroller pin compatible with PWM. 

###### A low pass filter was connected on the microcontroller output to get a cleaner analog signal but was not needed, the electric scooter was able to take the "raw" PWM signal without any problems.

#### Software

###### The microcontroller polls the pin that the button is connected, the microcontroller outputs a PWM value of ~0.9V  if the button is not pressed, running function "StopMotor". The microcontroller will output a PWM value matching ~4.2V if it detects a button press, running function (StartMotor).

###### No adjustability was necessary in this case to a simple MAX throttle NO throttle worked pretty well, the throttle can be adjusted by simply varying the "MAX" variable value in the ramp function.

```c++
//Arduino code to adjust the throttle of the EVB 500 electric scooter

//Pins used for the project
const int OutputPin = 3;
const int ButtonPin = 4;

int ButtonState = 0;

//Values for the throttle adjustment
int MIN = 40; 
int MAX = 225;
int Counter = MIN;  

void setup() {
    
  pinMode(OutputPin, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(ButtonPin, INPUT);
}

void RunMotor(){
  
  while(ButtonState == HIGH){
    
    if( Counter <= MAX){
      Counter++;
    }
    
    analogWrite(OutputPin, Counter);
    ButtonState = digitalRead(ButtonPin);
  }
  
  Counter = MIN;
  return;
}

void StopMotor(){
  Counter = MIN;
  analogWrite(OutputPin, Counter);
  return;
}


void loop() {
  
  ButtonState = digitalRead(ButtonPin);


  if(ButtonState == HIGH){
    RunMotor();
  }
  
  else{
    StopMotor();
  }
}
```

###### I was unable to capture the ramp-up of the PWM signal, it was too fast... 



### Final thoughts and images of the completed mod

###### The electric scooter works great, no throttle glitches or other problems related to the throttle. It was more convenient to just use a button to accelerate instead of using a throttle grip. All electronics are connected to the old sensor cables and the power is cut when the power switch is flipped. A standard bicycle grip will probably be used instead of the old throttle grip.
